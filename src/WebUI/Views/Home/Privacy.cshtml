                        II. What Personal Data Do We Collect?
                        We may collect information about you when you visit our Sites or use our Services, including the following:

                        Registration and use information – When you register to use our Services by establishing an Account, we will collect Personal Data as necessary to offer and fulfill the Services you request.  Depending on the Services you choose, we may require you to provide us with your name, postal address, telephone number, email address and identification information to establish an Account.  We may require you to provide us with additional Personal Data as you use our Services.
                        Transaction and experience information – When you use our Services or access our Sites, for example, to make purchases from merchants, to receive money, to process payments, or to send money to friends and family, we collect information about the transaction, as well as other information associated with the transaction such as amount sent or requested, amount paid for products or services, merchant information, including information about any funding instruments used to complete the transaction, Device Information, Technical Usage Data, and Geolocation Information.
                        Participant information – When you use our Services or access our Sites, we collect Personal Data you provide us about the other participants associated with the transaction.
                        Send or request money:  When you send or request money through the Services, we collect Personal Data such as name, postal address, telephone number, and financial account information about the participant who is receiving money from you or sending money to you.  The extent of Personal Data required about a participant may vary depending on the Services you are using to send or request money.
                        Pay or request someone else to pay a bill:  If you use our Services to pay a bill for the benefit of someone else, or if you request a User to pay a bill for you, we collect Personal Data from you about the account holder such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and account number of the bill that you intend to pay or request to be paid.
                        Add value to your accounts:  If you use our Services to add value to your Account or any other account you may have, or if you ask a User to add value to any of these accounts, we may collect Personal Data from you about the other party, or from the other party about you to facilitate the request.  For example, if you use our Services to reload a mobile phone, or to request value be added to your mobile account, we may collect Personal Data and other information including mobile account number from the other participant.
                        Information about your friends and contacts – It may be easier for us to help you transact with your friends and contacts if you choose to connect your contact list information with your Account.

                        Information that you choose to provide us to obtain additional Services or specific online Services – If you request or participate in an optional Site feature, or request enhanced Services or other elective functionality, we may collect additional information from you.  We will provide you with a separate notice at the time of collection, if the use of that information differs from the uses disclosed in this Privacy Statement.
                        Information about you if you use the Service “Checkout without a PayPal Account” – Certain limited Services are available without being required to log in to or establish an Account, also referred to as Checkout without a PayPal Account. We will collect Personal Data, information about any funding instrument used, Device Information, Technical Usage Data, and Geolocation Information as necessary to complete the transaction. If you are an Account holder and choose to engage in a Checkout with a PayPal Account transaction, we will collect information about the transaction and may associate it with your Account. If you are not an Account holder and choose to engage in a Checkout without a PayPal Account transaction, we will collect and store all information you provide and use and share such information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
                        Information about you from third-party sources – We obtain information from third-party sources such as merchants, data providers, and credit bureaus, where permitted by law.
                        Other information we collect related to your use of our Sites or Services – We may collect additional information from or about you when you communicate with us, contact our customer support teams or respond to a survey.

                        We retain Personal Data to fulfill our legal or regulatory obligations and for our business purposes.

                        IV.  How Do We Process Personal Data?
                        We may Process your information for the following reasons:

                        To operate the Sites and provide the Services, including to:
                        initiate a payment, send or request money, add value to an account, or pay a bill;
                        authenticate your access to an Account;
                        communicate with you about your Account, the Sites, the Services, or PayPal;
                        create an account connection between your Account and a third-party account or platform;
                        perform creditworthiness and other financial standing checks, evaluate applications, and compare information for accuracy and verification purposes; and
                        keep your Account and financial information up to date.
                        To manage our business needs, such as monitoring, analyzing, and improving the Services and the Sites’ performance and functionality. For example, we analyze User behavior and perform research about the way you use our Services.
                        To manage risk and protect the Sites, the Services and you from fraud by verifying your identity. PayPal’s risk and fraud tools use Personal Data, Device Information, Technical Usage Data and Geolocation Information from our Sites and websites that offer PayPal Services to help detect and prevent fraud and abuse of the Services.
                        To market to you about PayPal products and Services and the products and services of unaffiliated businesses. We may also Process your Personal Data to tailor the marketing content and certain Services or Site experiences to better match our understanding of your interests on PayPal and other third-party websites.
                        To provide personalized Services offered by PayPal on third-party websites and online services. We may use your Personal Data and other information collected in accordance with this Privacy Statement to provide a targeted display, feature, Services or offer to you on third-party websites.  We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide these online services and/or work with other third-parties such as merchants, advertising or analytics companies to provide these online services.
                        To provide you with location-specific options, functionality or offers if you elect to share your Geolocation Information through the Services.  We will use this information to enhance the security of the Sites and Services and provide you with location-based Services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content.
                        To comply with our obligations and to enforce the terms of our Sites and Services, including to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
                        To make it easier for you to find and connect with others, we may use your information you have shared with the Service to suggest connections between you and people you may know.  For example, we may associate information that we learn about you through your and your contacts’ use of the Services, and information you and others provide to suggest people you may know or may want to transact with through our Services.  Social functionality and features designed to simplify your use of the Services with others vary by Service.
                        To respond to your requests, for example to contact you about a question you submitted to our customer service team.

                        V.  Do We Share Personal Data?
                        We may share your Personal Data or other information about you with others in a variety of ways as described in this section of the Privacy Statement. In addition, our Consumer Privacy Notice provides specific information about the reasons why we share the Personal Data of certain United States residents with unaffiliated third parties.

                        We may share your Personal Data or other information for the following reasons:

                        With other members of the PayPal corporate family: We may share your Personal Data with members of the PayPal family of entities to, among other things, provide the Services you have requested or authorized; to manage risk; to help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements; and to help us manage the availability and connectivity of PayPal products, Services, and communications.

                        With other companies that provide services to us: We may share Personal Data with third-party service providers that perform services and functions at our direction and on our behalf.  These third-party service providers may, for example, provide you with Services, verify your identity, assist in processing transactions, send you advertisements for our products and Services, or provide customer support.

                        With other financial institutions: We may share Personal Data with other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product, such as with Synchrony Bank in connection with the PayPal Extras credit card.  These financial institutions may only use this information to market and offer PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses. We may also share Personal Data to process transactions, provide you with benefits associated with your eligible cards, and keep your financial information up to date.

                        With the other parties to transactions when you use the Services, such as other Users, merchants, and their service providers: We may share information about you and your Account with the other parties involved in processing your transactions. This includes other Users you are sending or receiving funds from, and merchants and their service providers. The information might include:

                        Personal Data and Account Information necessary to facilitate the transaction;
                        information to help other participant(s) resolve disputes and detect and prevent fraud; and
                        aggregated data and performance analytics to help merchants better understand Users and to help merchants enhance Users’ experiences.
                        With other third parties for our business purposes or as permitted or required by law: We may share information about you with other parties for PayPal’s business purposes or as permitted or required by law, including:

                        if we need to do so to comply with a law, legal process or regulations;
                        to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, a court order or other legal process or requirement applicable to PayPal or PayPal’s corporate family;
                        if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of Personal Data is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity;
                        to protect the vital interests of a person;
                        to investigate violations of or enforce a user agreement or other legal terms applicable to any Service;
                        to protect our property, Services and legal rights;
                        to facilitate a purchase or sale of all or part of PayPal’s business;
                        in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using a Service;
                        to help assess and manage risk and prevent fraud against us, our Users and fraud involving our Sites or use of our Services, including fraud that occurs at or involves our business partners, strategic ventures, or other individuals and merchants, such as eBay, Inc.;
                        to banking partners as required by card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants;
                        to credit reporting and collection agencies;
                        to companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by; and
                        to support our audit, compliance, and corporate governance functions.
                        With your consent: We also will share your Personal Data and other information with your consent or direction, including if you authorize an account connection with a third-party account or platform.

                        In addition, PayPal may provide aggregated statistical data to third-parties, including other businesses and members of the public, about how, when, and why Users visit our Sites and use our Services.  This data will not personally identify you or provide information about your use of the Sites or Services.  We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.

                        VI.  How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?
                        A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.  For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.  When you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.  Examples of account connections include:

                        linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;
                        connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or
                        using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.
                        If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.  For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.  If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.  We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.

                        Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.  Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.  For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.

                        VII.  How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?

Certain aspects and features of our Services and Sites are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you choose to disable or decline Cookies, your use of the Sites and Services may be limited or not possible.

                        Choices Relating to Account Connections
                        If you authorize an account connection to a third-party account or platform, such as a social media account, you may be able to manage your connection preferences from your Account or the third-party account or platform.  Please refer to the privacy notice that governs the third-party platform for more information on the choices you may have.
                        Choices Relating to Cookies
                        You may have options available to manage your cookies preferences.

You may choose to enable these options, but doing so may prevent you from using many of the core features and functions available on a Service or Site.
                        You may have an option regarding the use of cookies and other tracking technologies when you use a Service or visit parts of a Site.  For example, you may be asked if you want the Service or Site to “remember” certain things about you, and we will use cookies and other tracking technologies to the extent that you permit them.

                        Google ReCaptcha

                        PayPal uses ReCaptcha on the Sites and Services. Your use of ReCaptcha is subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

                        ReCaptcha is only used to fight spam and abuse.

                        Overview
                        This privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services. Reading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.

                        “Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.

                        “PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc. This privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal. To learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.



                        Your privacy rights and choices
                        When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.

                        Understanding your rights
                        You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months. You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you. If you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us . We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.

                        If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.

                        If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:

                        Log in to your account and delete information you previously added. For example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings
                        Call us and request that we delete specific information
                        Close your account
                        If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:

                        Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us
                        Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity
                        Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech
                        Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services
                        Comply with laws
                        Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data. For example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  Consumers may read our Consumer Privacy Notice  for more information about their rights under US federal law.



                        Understanding your choices
                        You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.

                        Choose how we collect personal data

                        You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it

                        To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.  Also, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.

                        For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.

                        Another example is creating an account with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.

                        Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data

                        If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.

                        You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.

                        Choose how we communicate with you

                        Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.

                        You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.

                        You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.



                        The personal data we collect
                        We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.

                        If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location. When you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law. We may connect this information with your account, if you have one.

                        7. Audio, electronic, visual, or similar information, for example:

                        Where personal data comes from
                        We may collect personal information about you from various sources, for example from:

                        You
                        Merchants
                        Our payment partners, such as card networks and payment processors
                        Financial institutions, such as banks
                        Credit bureaus
                        Service providers, such as companies that help us manage risk and fraud, deliver services to you, and market our services
                        We do not knowingly collect personal information from people who are not allowed to use our sites and services, such as children under the age of 13. Contact us  if you believe that we’ve mistakenly collected personal data from someone not allowed to use our services. We’ll delete it immediately, unless we’re legally required to keep it.

                        How we use tracking technologies like cookies
                        We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services. The information collected with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.

                        You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.

                        Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.

                        If you want to know more about how we use cookies, read our Cookie Statement . To learn how to opt-out of this kind of tracking technology, visit About Ads .



                        Why we collect personal data
                        We collect personal data for many reasons, including to improve your experience, and to run our business. Specific reasons why we collect your personal data include:

                        Run our sites and provide better services, for example to help you send or request money, make purchases, show you your account information, verify access to your account, and keep your account and payment information up to date.
                        Manage and improve our business. For example, we do user research to improve our products’ performance and abilities.  We also monitor and analyze our sites to help ensure they work as expected.
                        Protect our business and our customers from risk and fraud, including fraud that  involves our business partners, strategic ventures, or other individuals and merchants, such as eBay, Inc.
                        Send you marketing information about our products and services. We may use personal data to market about our partners, such as merchants. We use personal data to better understand and cater to your interests.
                        Personalize your experience when you use our sites and services, as well as other third-party sites and services. In this case, we might use tracking technologies like cookies. See our Cookie Statement for more details.
                        Send you locally relevant options, but only if you agree to let us track your location. If you do, this can help us enhance the security of our sites and services, and customize our services by using the right language and personalizing content such as ads and search results.
                        Make it easy for you to find and connect with others. For instance, if you let us access your contacts, we can suggest connections with people you may know.
                        Contact you when you need us, such as answering a question you sent to our customer service team.

                        Third-party tools used to help fight spam and abuse. For instance, we use ReCaptcha to help determine whether you’re a person or a computer. When you use ReCaptcha, your personal data is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
